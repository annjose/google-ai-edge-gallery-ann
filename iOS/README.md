ðŸ“Š **Performance Monitoring**
- Real-time inference metrics (TTFT, tokens/sec, latency)
- Model configuration and parameter tuning
- Performance benchmarking tools

## Architecture

The iOS app follows modern iOS development best practices:

### MVVM Architecture
- **Views**: SwiftUI views for the user interface
- **ViewModels**: ObservableObject classes handling business logic
- **Models**: Data models and business entities

### Dependency Injection
- `AppContainer`: Centralized dependency injection container
- Protocol-based architecture for testability
- Repository pattern for data access

### Navigation
- SwiftUI NavigationStack for type-safe navigation
- Custom NavigationManager for complex navigation flows
- Modal presentations for model management

### Data Layer
- Repository pattern for model and download management
- DataStore for persistent storage using UserDefaults and Keychain
- Network layer with URLSession for model downloads

### Security
- Keychain integration for secure token storage
- AES encryption for sensitive data
- Privacy-first design with on-device processing

## Requirements

- iOS 17.0 or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- Swift 5.9 or later
- iPhone or iPad with A12 Bionic chip or newer (recommended)

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- Install Xcode 15.0 or later from the Mac App Store
- Ensure you have a valid Apple Developer account for device testing

### 2. Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/google-ai-edge/ai-edge-gallery.git
   cd ai-edge-gallery/iOS
   ```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open GalleryApp.xcodeproj
   ```

3. Select your development team in the project settings
4. Choose a target device or simulator
5. Build and run the project (âŒ˜+R)

### 3. Configuration

The app uses a model allowlist file (`model_allowlist.json`) that defines available models. You can:

- Use the included sample models
- Add your own models to the allowlist
- Import local .task files through the app

### 4. Running on Device

For on-device AI inference, it's recommended to test on a physical device rather than the simulator for accurate performance metrics.

## Key Components

### AppContainer
Centralized dependency injection container that manages:
- Data repositories
- Network services
- File management
- App lifecycle

### NavigationManager
Handles navigation between screens and modal presentations:
- Type-safe navigation with NavigationPath
- Model manager overlay coordination
- Deep linking support

### Model Repository
Manages model lifecycle:
- Loading models from allowlist
- Tracking download and initialization status
- Importing local models
- Model configuration management

### Download Repository
Handles model downloads:
- Progress tracking
- Background downloads
- Retry logic
- HuggingFace authentication

## Performance Considerations

The app is optimized for on-device AI inference:

- **Memory Management**: Automatic model cleanup and memory monitoring
- **Background Processing**: Models can be downloaded while app is backgrounded
- **Progressive Loading**: UI remains responsive during model operations
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching of model assets and responses

## Testing

The app includes comprehensive previews for SwiftUI components:

```bash
# Run in Xcode
# Each View file includes #Preview blocks for SwiftUI previews
# Use the preview canvas to test UI components
```

## Contributing

This is a reference implementation demonstrating iOS AI capabilities. Key areas for contribution:

1. **Model Integration**: Add support for new model types
2. **Performance Optimization**: Improve inference speed and memory usage
3. **UI/UX Enhancements**: Improve user experience and accessibility
4. **Platform Features**: Leverage iOS-specific capabilities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Errors**: Ensure you're using Xcode 15.0+ and iOS 17.0+ deployment target
2. **Model Loading**: Check internet connection for initial model downloads
3. **Performance**: Test on physical devices for accurate performance metrics
4. **Storage**: Monitor device storage for large model files

### Debug Mode

The app includes comprehensive logging for debugging:
- Model loading and initialization
- Download progress and errors
- Inference performance metrics
